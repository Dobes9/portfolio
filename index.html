            <h2>About Richard</h2>
            <p>
                I am a professional orchestral clarinetist, and have been playing for 20 years. I love what I do, 
                but am facing difficulties in my field due to the ongoing pandemic. I hope to be able to continue being a musician while 
                also being pragmatic by getting into the tech field.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am excited to begin this new path. 2020 has been a difficult year, and I hope my time with Thinkful will start
                off 2021 well!
            </p>
            <p>
                I look forward to working with new people. If you are looking for someone to collaborate with, do not hesitate to reach out to me!
